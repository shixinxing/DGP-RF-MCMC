This directory is from the code of ICML 2017 Paper "Random Feature Expansions for Deep Gaussian Processes".

Some adaptations are made to the files related to data loading, default settings and process printing.

Other sub-directories remain the same as the original code, so I do not upload them.

The code runs on tensorflow 1.13.
